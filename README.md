## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
